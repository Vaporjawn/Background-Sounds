## Reporting a Vulnerability


If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by sending an email to [victor.williams.dev@gmail.com](mailto:victor.williams.dev@gmail.com). We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

We take security seriously and will respond to reported vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will provide regular updates on the progress of fixing the vulnerability.

What to expect:
- Once the report is received, we will acknowledge its receipt within 48 hours.
- We will work diligently to investigate and address the reported vulnerability.
- We will keep you informed of the progress and expected timelines for resolution.
- Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will notify you and, if appropriate, acknowledge your contribution in our release notes.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!
